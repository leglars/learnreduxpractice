One of the advantages of bone conduction is privacy so that we can create a private communication space within a public context. Meanwhile, to deliver an intuitive experience, we consider the relationship between materials, metaphors, and behaviors. Besides, we embed an anonymous and cross-time communication experience into a folktale called 'Don't tell a secret to a tree hole.'</div>" +
