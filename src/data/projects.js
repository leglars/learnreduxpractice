One of the advantages of bone conduction is privacy so that we can create a private communication space within a public context. Meanwhile, to deliver an intuitive experience, we consider the relationship between materials, metaphors, and behaviors. Besides, we embed an anonymous and cross-time communication experience into a folktale called <a href='https://medium.com/@mowen/cambodia-tell-a-tree-hole-your-secret-f661db9ab796'><span class='reference'>'Tell a secret to a tree hole.'</span></a></div>"
